NAME
    MARC::Simple - Rudimentary parsing of MARC format bibliographic data

REQUIREMENTS
    Perl 5.6.0 is required.

    The following non-standard modules are needed:

      Params::Validate

Installation
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the
    newer Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use nmake instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build
      perl Build test
      perl Build install    

SYNOPSIS
      use MARC::Simple;

      $marc = MARC::Simple->new( data => $data );

      $author = $marc->get_fields( field => '245', subfields => [qw(a b c)] );
      $title  = $marc->get_fields( field => '245', subfields => [qw(a n p)] );

DESCRIPTION
    This module performs some very rudimentary parsing (it parses field/
    subfield values but ignores indicators) of MARC MicroLIF format
    bibliographic data.

    This module was written for a project that was abandoned before
    completion. *So this code is unsupported*, but released because it
    was already written, and may be of use to somebody.

SEE ALSO
    If it does not meet your needs, then please look at the following Perl
    modules:

      MARC
      MARC::Record
